To run the Frontend:
+ cd Frontend
+ npm run dev (make sure you have the node_modules, if not you have to run npm install first)

To run the project:
+ python manage.py runserver

To run the Langflow 
+ pip install langflow
+ python -m langflow run

Note: in the newsletterapp/settings.py, it is using the evironment variable called FLOW_ID, that is why you have to create a file called .env in the root directory and set up a variable like below:

FLOW_ID="YOUR_LANGFLOW_FLOW_ID"
